// scope witnin {} is called block scope and outside scope is caled global scope like below

let a = 300;
const b =90;
var c = 40;
// these are global scope

if(true){
    let a=20;
    const b=30;
    var c =22;
    // this is called block scope
    console.log("inner:", a);//20
    console.log(b);//30
    
     
}
console.log(a);//300
console.log(c);//22 b'coz var is changeble within scope
